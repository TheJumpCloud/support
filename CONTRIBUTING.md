## Contributing

### PowerShell Module

Contributions to the JumpCloud PowerShell Module will be considered and reviewed by a member of the Customer Tools team.

New versions of the PowerShell Module requires a semantic version change within the [module manifest file](./PowerShell/JumpCloud%20Module/JumpCloud.psd1) and the [changelog](./PowerShell/ModuleChangelog.md) to be updated.

Pull requests should be labeled with a semantic version type: `major`, `minor` or `patch` along with `PowerShell Module`.

### Commands Gallery

Pull Requests with changes, additions and removed commands to the `Powershell/JumpCloud Commands Gallery` directory should be submitted and labeled with the `Commands Gallery` label

### Other Changes

Other pull requests outside of the JumpCloud PowerShell Module and Commands Gallery scripts may be submitted
