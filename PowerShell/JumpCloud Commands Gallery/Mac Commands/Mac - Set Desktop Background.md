#### Description

The "JumpCloud_Background.png" file is downloaded to the local machine and saved in the folder "/Users/Shared"/

To modify this command to download and set a background image of your choice follow the steps under '*** Customize ***' by updating the backgroundURL and corresponding fileType variables.

This command used in tandem with the wallpaper modification Mac policy can be used to set and then prevent end users from updating their background.

This command can be built manually as a Mac command where the 'run-as' user is set to the JC managed user on that machine and can not be executed as the root user.

#### *Import This Command*

To import this command into your JumpCloud tenant run the below command using the [JumpCloud PowerShell Module](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/support/wiki/Installing-the-JumpCloud-PowerShell-Module)

```
Import-JCCommand -URL 'https://git.io/jccg-Mac-SetDesktopBackground'
```

#### **Troubleshooting Tips**

Check to see if the file is downloading on the machine by navigating to /Users/Shared folder.
If the image file is not downloading to the machine it is likely that the 'fileType' has not been updated to match the file (png/jpg)
