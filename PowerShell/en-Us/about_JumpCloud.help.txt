TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    Your JumpCloud API key is needed for running any function in the JumpCloud
    module. This can be found in the JumpCloud admin console within 'API
    Settings' accessible from the drop down icon next to the admin email address
    in the top right corner of the JumpCloud admin console. Note that each
    administrator within a JumpCloud tenant has their own unique API key and can
    reset this API key from this settings page.
