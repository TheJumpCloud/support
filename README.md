# support

The purpose of this support repo is to provide helpful scripts that complement various JumpCloud services including API examples.

- Feel free to submit PRs, please see [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information
- Your API Key, keep it secret, keep it safe
- Use example scripts at your own risk, this repo is maintained mainly by support staff and does not go through the normal Dev/QA process

Some scripts use the deprecated (and out-of-date) JCAPI. In many cases, these scripts fail when running against multi-tenant user data.
Since most (if not all) functionality is available elsewhere (e.g., in PowerShell scripts), these scripts will not be officially adjusted.
