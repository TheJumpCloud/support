## Pre-requisites
- [Your JumpCloud API key](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/2.0/authentication-and-authorization/authentication-and-authorization-overview)
- [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- [AWS SAM CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- [A Customer Master Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-cmk-keystore.html#create-cmk-keystore-console) for encrypting your JumpCloud API Key while at rest
- [A role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html#roles-creatingrole-service-console) with AWSLambdaExecute permissions
  - For example:
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "logs:*"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:GetObject",
                    "s3:PutObject"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
- A valid Amazon S3 bucket policy that grants the service read permissions for artifacts uploaded to Amazon S3 when you package your application.
  - Go to the [S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)
  - Choose the S3 bucket that you will use to package your application
  - Permissions > Bucket Policy
  - Paste the following Policy Statement into the Bucket Policy Editor (replace `<YOUR BUCKET NAME>` with the name of your S3 bucket)
    ```
    {
          "Version":"2012-10-17",
          "Statement":[
              {
                "Effect":"Allow",
                "Principal":{
                    "Service":"serverlessrepo.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "Action":"s3:GetObject",
                "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR BUCKET NAME>/*",
                "Condition":{
                    "StringEquals":{
                      "aws:SourceAccount":"AWS::AccountId"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  
## Create Python Script

Create a directory to store your Serverless Application and any dependencies required. In the root of that directory create your [Python Script](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/support-admin-tools/blob/master/Kyles%20Stuff/AWS%20SAM/python/JumpCloud%20Events/get-jcevents.py).

This Application requires `boto3`, and `requests`. Install these dependencies using pip3. Within the directory you created, run the following commands to install the dependencies within the directory.
```bash
~/jc-events$ pip3 install boto3 -t .
~/jc-events$ pip3 install requests -t .
```

Create a ZIP archive of the Python script and the dependencies.
```
~/jc-events$ zip -r get-jcevents.zip .
```

## Create SAM Template

In the root of your directory, create a SAM template named [serverless.yaml](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/support-admin-tools/blob/master/Kyles%20Stuff/AWS%20SAM/python/JumpCloud%20Events/serverless.yaml).

_Note: The example template provided assumes that you have named your ZIP file get-jcevents.zip. If this is not true, update the `CodeUri` property to reflect the correct name._ \
_This also assumes the name of your Python script is named get-jcevents.py and the `def` in your python script is named jc_events. If neither of these is true, update the `Handler` property to match a <script_name>.<def_name> format._

## Package and Deploy the Application

### Packaging the Application
Using the AWS SAM CLI, package your application. This will upload your ZIP archive and `serverless.yaml` file to an S3 bucket. It will also create a file named `packaged.yaml` in your directory. `packaged.yaml` is an updated version of the SAM template that you provided that now directs to your S3 bucket and the script and dependencies now stored within it.
```
~/jc-events$ sam package --template-file serverless.yaml --output-template-file packaged.yaml --s3-bucket <YOUR S3 BUCKET>
```
_Note: Provide the name of the S3 bucket that you created for packaging and storing your application._


### Deploying the Application

Using the AWS CLI, you can [deploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/deploy/index.html) your template directly from your terminal.
```
~/jc-events$ aws cloudformation deploy --template-file ./packaged.yaml --stack-name <YOUR STACK NAME> --parameter-overrides JumpCloudApiKey=<API KEY> KmsKeyArn=<CMK ARN> RoleArn=<ROLE ARN> IncrementType=<INCREMENT TYPE> IncrementAmount=<INCREMENT AMOUNT>
```
_Note: IncrementType accepts "minute", "minutes", "hour", "hours", "day", and "days". Use the singular if the IncrementAmount is "1"._

### Alternative: Publish the Application

Rather than deploying your Application from the CLI, you can also publish your application so that it is viewable via the [Severless Application Repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/). By default, published applications are "Private" so they will not be publicly available until set otherwise.

Using the AWS SAM CLI, publish your application to the Serverless Applications Repository.
```
~/jc-events$ sam publish --template packaged.yaml --region <REGION>
```
Once you have published your Application to the [Severless Application Repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/), you can find and deploy your application from the Private Applications tab.
