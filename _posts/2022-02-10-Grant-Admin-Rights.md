(Update 04/02/2024) Temporary admin access can be granted with the JumpCloud console, plesae see the documentation on [Granting Administraor Rights](https://thejumpcloud.github.io/support/2022/02/10/Grant-Admin-Rights.html) for more formation.
 
The purpose of this script is to grant admin access to a JumpCloud user to a bound system.
This script prompts the user to enter username, system Id, and minutes of how long the user is going to be an admin/sudo. After granted admin status, the user will need to re-login if on Windows machine to see the admin access change. The user is revoked admin status after x mins. User must re-login if on Windows machine to be demoted to standard user. 

### Basic Usage

* The PowerShell Module is required to run this script
* Save the script to your desired location
* In a PowerShell terminal window, run the script `~/Path/To/Scrpt/filename.ps1`
* Follow the prompts to enter:
    * Username
    * System Id
    * Amount of minutes user is granted admin access
* User will need to re-login if on Windows Machine to be granted/revoked admin access

### Additional Information

* Run the script from your desired directory
* Mac and Linux machines will not need to re-login

* Powershell prompts to grant admin rights
