## 1.0.4

Release Date: June 5, 2023

#### RELEASE NOTES

```
Addressed an issue on macOS with EmailSAN and EmailDN type cert deployments where assigning network SSIDs during certificate import.
```

#### Bug Fixes:

- In previous versions, deploying either an EmailSAN or EmailDN type cert would throw an error while attempting to associate a network SSID to the newly imported certificate. The cert identifier in this case was updated to the SHA1 hash of the certificates instead of the common name (which was incorrectly identified in previous iterations of these example scripts).
