.DESCRIPTION
    This script identifies JumpCloud managed systems that can have a Primary User assigned. 
    It allows an administrator to provide a "ignore list" of usernames to exclude from consideration. 

    Primary User is assigned in two cases:
    1.  The system has exactly one associated user (who is directly associated and not on the ignore list).
    2.  The system has multiple directly associated users, but all except one are on the ignore list.

    Before making any changes, a CSV file is generated for review and prompts for final confirmation. 
    The script uses the JumpCloud PowerShell module for all reads/writes of the relevant JumpCloud organization.
